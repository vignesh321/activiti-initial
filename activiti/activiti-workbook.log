how to solve it ?
Also the user needs to provide the process Instance Id which can be then used for closing 
1 make a rest service awaiting for input 
if the approver chooses submit, then trigger the service through post method and then pull out the choice of the approver 
and process it 

2 Else also try to close/complete it via variables and see ...


3. Also look for disabling the security validator.



List of services URI's running :

GET and POST as well : localhost:8080/identity/users
-- sample POST response 
{
            "id": "root",
            "firstName": "root",
            "lastName": null,
            "url": "http://localhost:8080/identity/users/admin",
            "email": "admin.activiti@abc.com",
            "pictureUrl": null,
            "password" : "root"
}




-- 
check for the variable name and senf the response from the form

/runtime/executions/{executionId}/variables/{variableName}


--

creating variables before hand and then populating them on time will help

like if status variable is present before hand and while completing the User Task, the status variable can be initiated.
